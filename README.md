# Basedef

This is an online, collaborative BASEDEF contribution matrix to replace the physical whiteboard in the methodology described
by [Joe Nelson](https://github.com/begriffs) in [Making 20% Time Work](http://begriffs.com/posts/2016-01-29-making-twenty-percent-time-work.html)
to allow remote teams to work with this methodology too.

:warning: This is a project to learn [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org), don't expect too much...

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
